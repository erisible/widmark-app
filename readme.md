##Usage

###Requirements

* [npm](https://npmjs.org/)
* [bower](http://bower.io/)

###Installation

`cd` into the app directory and run :
```
npm install & bower install
```

Running `grund build` will generate the release in the `dist` directory.

**Note: due to the simplicity of the app, I didn't configure the tests so running `grunt` will cause an error.**

##Todo

* Some UI improvements.
* Internationalize/localize the app (add translations and localized time formats).
